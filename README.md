# 👋 Hi there, I'm Bảo!

I'm a **DevSecOps engineer** with a background in Computer Science and a long-standing obsession with cybersecurity.  
These days, I’m diving into **pwn** (and mostly getting pwned), wrangling **DevSecOps pipelines**, and occasionally pretending to study **AI** just to stay relevant.

## 🌟 About Me

- 🎓 Graduate of **VNUK Institute of Research and Executive Education**  
- 🔐 **DevSecOps Engineer** – building secure systems while breaking insecure ones  
- 🧠 Learning **binary exploitation** and finding out the hard way what a `segfault` really means  
- 🤖 Exploring **AI and LLMs**, mostly wondering how they don't segfault like my code  
- 🛠️ Automating security scans, breaking pipelines (sometimes intentionally), and writing code that works… eventually
